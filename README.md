## What is TIMING?
TIMING is the acronym for Time-lapse Imaging Microscopy in Nanowell Grids. It is a high-throughput single-cell imaging and image processing protocol developed and maintained by [Single-Cell Lab](http://singlecell.chee.uh.edu/) and [Farsight Group](http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/Main_Page) at University of Houston, Houston, Texas.

In TIMING, we put cells in controlled microenvironment, nanowells. The nanowells have the size of 50 um by 50 um, and in one nanowell, there are usually less than 10 cells in total. Different cells are stained with different fluorescent bio-markers. We do 4D imaging (X,Y,w,t) of the cells and analyze their interactions.

The nanowells are fabricated on PDMS slides and in one slide there are approximately 100,000 nanowells. Automatic analysis of huge amount of imaging data is necessary. We build a image processing and analysis pipeline to achieve this.

TIMING could boost immunotherapy. For example, we use TIMING to quantify the killing efficacy of CAR T-cells (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell, a geneticlly modified human T cell) and implement the optimal reprogrammed CAR T-cell for a specific patient.
